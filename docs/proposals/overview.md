# Proposal to Port Smallest AI Model for Latency Trial in Beast Automation Engine

## Overview

To validate the 60ms database latency in our "Beast" automation setup, we propose porting the smallest available AI model from our list to Nx/Elixir for a trial run. This will allow us to test the end-to-end performance without committing to larger, more resource-intensive models initially.
