## Summary

Porting Qwen-3VL will provide a low-risk way to trial our latency-tolerant architecture. The model's capabilities ensure useful functionality, while the database optimizations with CockroachDB v22.1.64b21683521d9a8735ad and file storage with SeaweedFS 4.05 prepare us for heavier workloads.
