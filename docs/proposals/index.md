# Database Latency Proposal

This proposal outlines porting the smallest AI model to Nx/Elixir for testing 60ms database latency using CockroachDB v22.1.64b21683521d9a8735ad and SeaweedFS 4.05 for distributed storage.

This proposal has been split into the following sections:

- [Expected Latency Impact](latency-impact.md)
- [Model Selection](model-selection.md)
- [Optimization Strategies](optimization-strategies.md)
- [Overview](overview.md)
- [Porting Process](porting-process.md)
- [Summary](summary.md)
- [Trial Goals](trial-goals.md)
